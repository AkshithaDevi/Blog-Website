# Blog-Website
A Blog Website - An EJS Challenge, with Node and Express.
#languages used are EJS, CSS, JS, Express
I have provided 3 files of app.js file which is of node, in public file you can find the css code and in views file you will be finding the ejs files where you set up them in your text editor(atom or vs) and open your terminal to run the code
before running the javascript code open your terminal, set the path to the profile directory and run the following commands->
commands:
npm init; 
npm start;
npm i express, body-parser; 
npm i ejs; 
npm i loadash; 
npm i nodemon; [ #this nodemon helps to keep track and updates the server automatically when any changes are made in js file ]
noodemon app.js [#runs the js file in the localhost , open your browser and got to localhost:3000/]

in this server you can see the blog-website where you can add daily routine, updates by going through https://localhost:3000/compose and you can add your title and post and click publish then you will be redirected into home page.
If you want to go to the title page you have created then go through https://localhost:3000/posts/title_name
